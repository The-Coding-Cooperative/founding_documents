# The Constitution

    Four score and seven semicolons ago our fathers brought forth on this computer, a new file, conceived in python, and dedicated to the proposition that all langueges are created equal (except Java).

    Now we are engaged in a great error code, testing whether that file, or any file so conceived and so dedicated, can long compile. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate partition of that drive, as a final resting place for those who here gave their hours of sleep to this battle. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
